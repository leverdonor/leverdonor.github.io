Dear reader,

Thank you for visiting this website. Through this website we would like to make an appeal. Mrs. Nazifa is mother of four children and loved by her husband and siblings. Unfortunately, her family members cannot help her. She is currently admitted to the hospital in a terrible condition. The doctors cannot tell us how long she has left, but her prognosis is poor. There is one life-saving treatment: liver transplantation. She has been on the waiting list for a liver transplant since the start of this year, yet no liver has become available. And every day her condition worsens.

Since three years she is dealing with liver cirrhosis. This liver disease was caused by the hepatitis virus. Currently, her liver is failing and other organ systems are getting involved: her kidney function has declined, she has been admitted to the ICU because of the effects on her brain and every day she has to deal with feeling miserable, nauseated, vomiting and itching skin. Every day in the past three years has been a terrible struggle, and it is only getting worse.

A new possibility has given us hope. In the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, living-donor transplantation has become possible, as an alternative to the deceased-donor program. Living donors can donate a portion of their liver. The remaining liver regenerates, grows back to nearly its original size and performs its normal function. However, this is not without risks. An explanation of the procedure and the risks can be found [here (in Dutch)][erasmus-trans] and [here (in English)][Engelstrans]. We are now looking for a donor.

The requirements for a potential liver donor are the following:
- the donor must be between the ages of 18 and 55
- the donor must have blood type O
- the donor must be in good health, i.e. people with medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus or liver diseases are not eligible

If you, dear reader, are someone, or know someone, who would be willing to save our motherâ€™s life through donation, we will be forever thankful to you. We would kindly ask any potential donor to e-mail us at [donorvoornazifa@gmail.com][mailadres].

Best wishes,

Thank you for sharing,

4 kids and husband of Nazifa
